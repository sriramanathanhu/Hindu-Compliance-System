## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Temple Administrator Dashboard Access (Priority: P1)

Temple administrators need to quickly access an overview of their compliance status, pending tasks, and critical alerts when they log into the system.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary entry point and most frequent user interaction. Without a functional dashboard, administrators cannot understand their compliance obligations or take action.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in as a temple administrator and viewing the dashboard. Delivers immediate value by showing compliance status overview without requiring any other features to be implemented.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a temple administrator has valid credentials, **When** they log in, **Then** they see a dashboard showing current compliance status with color-coded indicators (green/yellow/red)
2. **Given** a temple administrator is on the dashboard, **When** they view pending tasks, **Then** they see a prioritized list of compliance items requiring attention with due dates
3. **Given** a temple administrator has critical violations, **When** they access the dashboard, **Then** urgent alerts are prominently displayed at the top with clear action items
4. **Given** a temple administrator is viewing the dashboard, **When** they check recent activity, **Then** they see a timeline of recent compliance submissions and status changes

---

### User Story 2 - Compliance Form Submission (Priority: P1)

Temple administrators need to submit compliance documentation and reports through digital forms that guide them through required information.

**Why this priority**: Form submission is the core functionality that enables temples to maintain compliance. This is the primary action users take in the system.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing a compliance form, filling required fields, uploading documents, and submitting. Delivers standalone value by digitizing the submission process.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a temple administrator needs to submit annual financial reports, **When** they access the financial compliance form, **Then** they see clearly labeled fields with inline help text and validation
2. **Given** a temple administrator is filling a compliance form, **When** they attempt to submit with missing required fields, **Then** clear error messages highlight incomplete sections
3. **Given** a temple administrator has supporting documents, **When** they upload files, **Then** the system accepts PDF, DOC, JPG formats up to 10MB with progress indicators
4. **Given** a temple administrator completes a form, **When** they submit, **Then** they receive confirmation with a submission reference number and expected review timeline

---

### User Story 3 - Compliance Status Tracking (Priority: P2)

Temple administrators need to track the status of submitted compliance documents and understand what actions are pending from regulators or their side.

**Why this priority**: After submission, administrators need visibility into processing status. This reduces uncertainty and support requests.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting a compliance form and then viewing its status through the tracking interface. Delivers value by providing transparency into the approval process.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a temple administrator has submitted documents, **When** they view their submissions list, **Then** they see status labels (Submitted, Under Review, Approved, Rejected, Needs Revision)
2. **Given** a submission is under review, **When** the administrator checks status details, **Then** they see current stage, assigned reviewer, and estimated completion date
3. **Given** a submission requires revisions, **When** the administrator views it, **Then** they see specific feedback comments and can resubmit with corrections
4. **Given** a temple administrator filters submissions, **When** they select a date range or status type, **Then** results update to show matching submissions only

---

### User Story 4 - Mobile Responsive Access (Priority: P2)

Temple administrators need to access compliance information and perform basic tasks from mobile devices while on-site at temples or traveling.

**Why this priority**: Many administrators work across multiple temple locations and need mobile access. However, complex form submissions can remain desktop-focused initially.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing the site from mobile browsers (iOS/Android) and verifying dashboard viewing, status checking, and simple updates work correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a temple administrator accesses the site from a mobile phone, **When** the page loads, **Then** the layout adapts to mobile screen size with readable text and touch-friendly buttons
2. **Given** a temple administrator is on mobile, **When** they view the dashboard, **Then** key metrics and alerts are visible without horizontal scrolling
3. **Given** a temple administrator needs to check submission status, **When** they access the tracking page on mobile, **Then** they can view full status details and reviewer comments
4. **Given** a temple administrator is viewing forms on mobile, **When** complex forms are accessed, **Then** they receive a message suggesting desktop access for optimal experience but can still proceed if needed

---

### User Story 5 - Notifications and Alerts (Priority: P3)

Temple administrators need to receive timely notifications about compliance deadlines, submission status changes, and required actions.

**Why this priority**: Proactive notifications improve compliance rates, but the system provides value even without this feature through manual checking.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering notification scenarios (deadline approaching, status change) and verifying alerts appear in the notification center and via email.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a compliance deadline is 7 days away, **When** the administrator logs in, **Then** they see a notification badge with deadline alerts
2. **Given** a submission status changes to "Approved" or "Needs Revision", **When** the administrator checks notifications, **Then** they see the status update with submission reference
3. **Given** a temple administrator has multiple notifications, **When** they view the notification center, **Then** notifications are grouped by type and sorted by urgency/date
4. **Given** a temple administrator wants email notifications, **When** they configure preferences, **Then** they can enable/disable email alerts for specific event types

---

### User Story 6 - Help and Guidance System (Priority: P3)

Temple administrators need contextual help and guidance to understand compliance requirements and how to use the system effectively.

**Why this priority**: Reduces learning curve and support burden, but administrators can still complete tasks by trial and error or external support initially.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing help icons throughout the interface and verifying relevant guidance appears. Delivers value by improving user confidence and reducing errors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a temple administrator is on any page, **When** they click the help icon, **Then** they see contextual help relevant to that page or feature
2. **Given** a temple administrator is filling a complex form field, **When** they hover over or click the info icon, **Then** they see a tooltip explaining what's required with examples
3. **Given** a temple administrator needs general guidance, **When** they access the help center, **Then** they see FAQs, video tutorials, and compliance requirement explanations organized by category
4. **Given** a temple administrator searches help content, **When** they enter a query, **Then** relevant articles and tutorials appear ranked by relevance

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a temple administrator's session expires while filling a long compliance form? (System should auto-save progress and restore upon re-login)
- How does the system handle file uploads exceeding size limits or in unsupported formats? (Clear error message with format/size requirements and option to try again)
- What happens when a temple administrator tries to submit the same compliance form multiple times within a short period? (System detects duplicate and either prevents submission or asks for confirmation)
- How does the system handle network interruptions during form submission? (Retry mechanism with user feedback, or ability to resume submission)
- What happens when compliance requirements change mid-year and submitted forms become outdated? (System flags affected submissions and notifies administrators of new requirements)
- How does the system handle multiple administrators from the same temple submitting conflicting information? (Version control with conflict detection and resolution workflow)
- What happens when a temple administrator needs to view/submit forms but regulators haven't published requirements for current year? (Show previous year requirements with notice that current year is pending)
